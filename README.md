 - nil2histograms.py & plotting4.nb (& plotting4.nb.pdf)
	 - run the simulation with different parameters each with a large trial number
	 - compare time distributions with the same rho
	 - compare time distributions with predictions
	 - consider errors
 - 2mrca-length-distri.py & lengths.nb (& lengths.nb.pdf)
	 - runthe simulation and record both times and lengths of the coalescence
	 - plot the length distributions
	 - plot lengths with respect to times
