The files here are for generating the simulations in the rotation report.

To find the average fraction of separated pairs that have a common overlapping lineage, run file "averageFraction.nb" in any folder.  The graph will then be generated in the file with the data printed also in the file.

To run the simulation with the combinations of parameters used in the report, run file "simulation.py" in some folder A.  The simulated data for each condition will then be saved as a txt file in new folder B created in folder A, where folder B's name is the number of trials and bins (of histograms), and the file's name is the parameters used.  To then plot the simulated data with the predictions, run "comparison.nb" in folder B.  The graphs will be generated in the file.
